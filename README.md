# BMI Calculator Project

The BMI Calculator project is a web-based application developed using the Django framework, which leverages Python for backend logic and data management. The project uses MySQL as the database management system to store user data, including name, age, weight, and height, ensuring robust and scalable data handling. HTML and CSS are employed for creating the user interface, with specific emphasis on designing responsive and visually appealing layouts. Static files, including images, are managed efficiently to enhance user experience. The core functionality of the application includes calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user inputs and providing tailored health suggestions based on BMI classifications. The project's frontend employs modern CSS techniques for styling, ensuring that elements are well-aligned and images are appropriately placed to complement the textual content. The integration of static files and the Django templating system allows for dynamic content rendering, making the application both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
